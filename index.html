          <h1 class="is-size-3">Javascript</h1>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            I use javascript for all of my websites, giving a good feel to how
            they work. I also use nodeJS to run backend servers.

        <article class="python notification is-danger">
          <h1 class="is-size-3">Python</h1>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            Most of the python that I use is for simple machine learning uses
            and task automation. If I need to do something quickly, I'll use
            Python since it's the language that I can write in the fastest and
            most concise.

        <article class="cs notification is-info">
          <h1 class="is-size-3">C#</h1>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            Any major backend project that I work on will be using C# for a web
            server. ASP.NET Core has all the features needed to provide a good
            API for a website. Using EntityFramework alongside ASP.NET, there
            are the tools needed to scaffold a blazing fast website.

        <article class="react notification is-link">
          <h1 class="is-size-3">React</h1>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            99% of the websites I design will use React as a base for the
            javascript. It provides cleaner code, a more dynamic experience, and
            a very simple base for a complex website.

        <article class="labview notification is-warning">
          <h1 class="is-size-3">LabVIEW</h1>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            I use LabVIEW at work to create code that runs on machines. It is
            more designed towards hardware control than any of these other
            languages and allows for quick development and easy debugging.
          </p>

        <article class="html notification is-success">
          <h1 class="is-size-3">HTML & CSS</h1>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            With any website, HTML has to be the basic underlying form of it.
            Mixing that with just a little CSS, it can instantly look like a
            fully designed page. I use CSS Grid alongside CSS frameworks to make
            my designs work exactly how I want them to. It creates a very
            responsive layout, allowing elements to be anywhere I want them to
            be and giving a clean design.
